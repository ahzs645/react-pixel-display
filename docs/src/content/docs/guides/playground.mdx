description: Interactive playground to experiment with all PixelDisplay effects, colors, dimensions, and settings in real time.

import TickerPlayground from '../../../components/TickerPlayground.tsx';

The Ticker Playground lets you experiment with every `PixelDisplay` prop in real time. Tweak the text, pick an effect, adjust the speed, change colors, resize the display, and more — then copy the generated code straight into your project.

## Try it out

<TickerPlayground client:load />

## How to use

1. **Presets** — Start from a pre-built configuration (News Ticker, Retro Arcade, etc.) or build your own from scratch.
2. **Text** — Type any message. Ambient effects (fire, matrix, etc.) ignore text and fill the entire display.
3. **Effect** — Pick from 21 text effects, 3 color effects, and 19 ambient effects.
4. **Speed** — Drag the slider from 1 (slowest) to 100 (fastest).
5. **Colors** — Use the color pickers or type hex values for foreground and background.
6. **Dimensions** — Adjust width, height, scale, and pixel gap to get the perfect size.
7. **Glow & Renderer** — Toggle the LED glow effect and switch between rendering backends.
8. **Playback** — Pause and resume the animation at any time.
9. **Generated Code** — Copy the JSX snippet that matches your current configuration.
